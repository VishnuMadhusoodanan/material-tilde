# material tilde

A material design new tab/homepage based off of cadejscroggins' tilde startpage.

**Usage:**

It's pretty simple. To go to a site you just enter the corresponding key. To view the available commands, enter a `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic google search will be triggered.

**Examples:**

```
amazon                # takes you to amazon.com
twitter: donald trump  # searches Twitter for Donald Trump
github: twitter       # searches GitHub for Twitter
fb                # takes you to facebook.com
asdf             # searches google for asdf
```
