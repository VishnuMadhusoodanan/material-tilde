# material tilde

A material design new tab/homepage based off of [cadejscroggins' tilde startpage](https://cadejscroggins.github.io/tilde/).

[LIVE DEMO](http://vishnumadhusoodanan.github.io/material-tilde/)

**Usage:**

It's pretty simple. To go to a site you just enter the corresponding key. To view the available commands, enter a `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic google search will be triggered.

**Examples:**

```
amazon                 # takes you to amazon.com
twitter: donald trump  # searches Twitter for Donald Trump
github: twitter        # searches GitHub for Twitter
fb                     # takes you to facebook.com
asdf                   # searches google for asdf
```
